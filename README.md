# Third-Party Licenses Generator

Hi, my name is Mateus Gabi and I'm so happy to help you. The 3PLG is only avaible on npm.

## Install

```npm i third-party-licenses-generator```

## Run

```node .\node_modules\third-party-licenses-generator\index.js > [[filename]]```

A file named ```filename``` will be created.

## API

I'm sorry, but it is not avaible yet.
