# Third-Party Licenses Generator

Hi, my name is Mateus Gabi and I'm so happy to help you. The 3PLG is only avaible on npm.

## Install

```npm install third-party-licenses-generator --dev```

## Run

```$ cd app_path && node .\node_modules\third-party-licenses-generator\index.js```

A file named ```3PLG.txt``` will be created in app path.

## API

I'm sorry, but it is not avaible yet.
